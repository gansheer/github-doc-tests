This operator can work standalone and you can use the data exposed in the `CamelApp` custom resource accordingly. However it has a great fit with the [Camel Openshift Console Plugin](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#deployment-to-openshift), which is a visual representation of the services exposed by the operator.
